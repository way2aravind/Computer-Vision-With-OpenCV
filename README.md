# Computer Vision With OpenCV

This repository contains code and resources for **Day 20** of the #75DaysChallenge, focused on learning the basics of **Computer Vision with OpenCV**.  

## üñ•Ô∏è Overview
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library for real-time computer vision. This project demonstrates fundamental image processing tasks using OpenCV, including:
- Reading, displaying, and saving images.
- Image transformations (resizing, rotating, cropping).
- Color space conversions (RGB to Grayscale, HSV).
- Edge detection using the Canny method.
- Contour detection and object detection.

## üìÇ Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Code demonstrating various OpenCV operations.  
- **PowerPoint Presentation**: Summary of the concepts covered.  
- **Sample Images**: Example images used in the code.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/way2aravind/Computer-Vision-With-OpenCV.git
